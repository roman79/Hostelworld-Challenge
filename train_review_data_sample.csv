30820802,7391126,94,i really enjoyed my stay at bear on the lake boris was managing the hostel during my stay and he is an exceptional host be aware if you don t have a car that the hostel is 6km walk from the bus stop in whycocomagh and from the nearest grocery store but hitchhiking was always possible or else someone at the hostel might offer you a lift the only suggestion for improvement i would make would be to include a basic breakfast i will definitely stay here again,24183,2015-07-24 18:03:58,English
30820802,7347237,66,i know there are few choices of hostels in quebec and this one is fine but know that it is more of a cheap hotel than a hostel very large building with old furnishing the bathrooms and kitchen area feel a bit like boarding school in the rooms there is no air conditioning power points only on bottom bunks and the bunks are narrow and short if you are above 5 10 ask for a bottom bunk fine for a school trip and probably ok if you re traveling in a group but not great for solo travellers,6865,2015-07-12 10:56:07,English
30820802,6535044,94,great atmosphere in sunny lake easy to meet new people helpful staff and volunteers if you re not in a social mood don t stay here showers were a bit odd needed to fiddle a lot with the shower to get hot water good breakfast of you re up early enough and a great balcony to eat it on loved the hostel and the city wish we could have stayed longer,21202,2014-08-08 10:23:35,English
30820802,5810596,57,no locks on the dorm doors but someone is on reception most of the day lockers in the rooms are tall and skinny so a rucksack won t fit but you can put some valuables in facilities in the common room fairly poor dishes provided but you have to wash them in the bathroom without scrubbing brushes no ladders on the bunk beds slightly awkward when you don t know the person below you and have to spring on to the top bunk from their bed possibly while they re sleeping,29000,2013-08-29 09:23:55,English
30820802,6559620,100,stayed here for two nights pub crawl on one and bbq on the other great atmosphere and gorgeous room with a little kitchenette only thing i would change is that there were these small lights in the room no one could figure out how to turn off super close to the bus station and great location in the old town will definitely be staying again,62434,2014-08-16 09:03:51,English

30820802,5810624,60,second time we stayed at this hostel because the location is ideal you re given sheets at check in to make your bed which means you get a nice view of all the various stains on the mattresses and pillows there was also a thick layer of dust on my bed frame,29000,2013-08-29 09:30:36,English

30820802,6542830,89,our welcome to this hostel was not great no offer of a map no conversation at all and no keys given when we asked for recommendations of local activities we weren t given any however when we arrived back later on there was one very helpful staff member and they organised a komani lake tour for us good breakfast and relaxed atmosphere would stay again,75143,2014-08-11 07:25:13,English
30820802,6418919,83,wifi doesn t work in the rooms so the hostel should really update their bio to include that or else fix the wifi location is great for public transport but not good for atmosphere residential or for eating out better off staying in the centre towels not available for hire only available to buy lockers require a 10 deposit and bang loudly when you open them waking up dorm mates but if you push in the side with the hinge while opening them then it s fine very clean lovely staff,67989,2014-06-30 07:31:49,English
30820802,5775283,91,sweet family run hostel really close to the bus stop which only takes 10mins into old town and close to some nice beaches too breakfast is cheap 20 kuna and made by milka every morning who is the most fantastic person you will ever meet it s also a great chance to meet some other people staying in the hostel if you re really lucky you ll get treated to some philosophical musings from milka s yes man son nikolas wonderful hostel couldn t recommend it more d,18950,2013-08-20 11:03:25,English
